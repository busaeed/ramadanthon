A simple project that was made in 2 days in May 2021 for a ramadan hackthon and won third place in that hackthon.

The idea of the project is to provide a platform for volunteers who would like to arrange trips for elderly people staying in nursing homes.

For more information about the project please watch the following presentation video:
